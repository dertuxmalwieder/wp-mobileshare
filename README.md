# MobileShare

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

A simple WordPress plug-in that integrates the [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share) so you can easily add a button which lets your visitors share your WordPress articles and pages.

## Usage

Download, unpack, activate, enjoy (or don't).

## Support forum

Please discuss about this on [DonationCoder.com](http://www.donationcoder.com/forum/index.php?topic=47125.0).

## Donations (optional)

*MobileShare* is free software by the terms of the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/). As some people - including myself - like to contribute money for a good cause anyway, here are two possible options for you:

### Donate money to the nature:

Both [Kākāpō Recovery](http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/) and the [WWF](https://support.wwf.org.uk/adopt-a-panda) do a pretty good job at trying to keep species alive. You are invited to join their efforts.

### Donate money to me:

Yes, I like money as well.
